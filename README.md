# CS347Project
Repo for class project.

Project by Johann Lau and Michelle Wong.

Project done in Dev-C++ for now.

Windows: Just run the .exe to run the tests and play the "game".
(Alternatively, open game.dev in Dev C++.)

Linux: cd to folder, type make. Run using ./game. Or run the one already there.

Mac: We don't have one to try it on.
